# Slip Plane Stress

## Introduction
This folder contains the Matlab scripts used for calculating the stress distribution on a slip plane. For the moment this program simulates the movement of dislocations on a single slip plane.

Development is going on for simulating a series of identical slip planes (aka one slip system) and find the variation of stresses along the slip planes as well as one edge representing the extremities of all the slip planes (aka grain boundary).

## Launching the program
To launch the program, run the script dd2d.

## Input files
The following input files are provided: slipPlane.txt, dislList.txt, dsourceList.txt

Note that dislocation sources are not active yet. They will be at some future point.
